Embed Skada Damage Meter window to a Chat window named 'Skada'

Usage:
1. Create a chat window named 'Skada', not case sensitive, you can use 'SKADA' or 'SkAdA' or whatever.
2. Unsubscribe all chat messages from that chat window. Or just keep them to mess with your own eyes, your call.
3. Reload ui (using slash command /reload of course).
4. Whenever in doubt, reload ui.
